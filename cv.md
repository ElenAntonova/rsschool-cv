**About me**


I’m from Belarus and live in Minsk.
My career in IT was started as an Oracle + Delphi developer, hence, frontend and backend resonate with me.
Now I've been working as a software engineer for 9 years and my area of ​​expertise is developing core banking system.
I can say I excel at Oracle DB, SQL, PL/SQL, optimization, refactoring, etc. and relish a lot of development stages:
customer requirements analysis, communicating with the team and finding better solutions, making a development plan, coding, doing code review, mentoring and whatnot.
I’m interested in elevating my skills, so I spend my free time on self-education.
